# Data analysis of student's test results
## This notebook contains code written at the request of a psychology student who conducted a survey of students using the Beck, STAI, and stress level tests.

### The first stage includes full data processing including: loading data from excel format into notepad, data cleaning, conversion, recoding into categories, filling in empty values

### The second stage is interpreting the results based on the obtained results, determining the correlation between variables, assigning categories, combining all results into one data set, determining the correlation between variables and visualizing heat maps

### The third stage is dividing the data set into men and women to identify patterns present in certain genders, drawing graphs of deviations from the ideal correlation of individual cases

### The fourth stage is building a linear regression model, and determining the metrics MAE, R2, MSE, RMSE, comparing the actual and predicted values, residual graphs and their distribution, model coefficients and intercepts, estimating the accuracy of the model R^2, OLS Regression Results

### The fifth stage is drawing pie charts and comparing the test results separately for each gender on one graph for visual comparison of the dependence variables.
